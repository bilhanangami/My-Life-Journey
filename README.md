Web Hosting and Domain Name

This document explains the basic concepts of Domain Name and Web Hosting, which are essential for making a website available on the internet.

🌐 1. Domain Name

A domain name is the unique address of a website on the internet. It is what users type into a web browser to visit a website.

Example

www.google.com

www.mybusiness.com

Instead of remembering long numerical IP addresses, people use domain names because they are easy to read and remember.

Purpose

The domain name represents the identity or brand of a website. It helps users find and recognize your website online.

Registration

To use a domain name, you must register it through a domain registrar (such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains). Once registered, no one else can use that same domain name.

🖥️ 2. Web Hosting

Web hosting is a service that stores all the files of a website (such as text, images, videos, and code) and makes them available on the internet.

When someone types your domain name into a browser, the browser connects to your hosting server and displays your website.

What a Hosting Provider Does

A web hosting provider:

Stores your website files

Keeps the server running 24/7

Ensures your website is accessible to visitors

Provides security and backups

Example

If your domain name is www.myshop.com, the hosting server is where all the website data for myshop.com is kept.

🔗 How Domain Name and Web Hosting Work Together

The domain name is the address

The web hosting is the house where the website lives

When someone enters your domain name in a browser, it points to your hosting server, which then shows your website.
